// JavaScript is an object all the data are stored in objects

// these are all data structure in JS
//data type (string)
console.log("Hello World");

//I could use tactiks as strings ``
console.log(`this is tacktics`);

// data type (number) as whole or floats which are decimals
console.log(3);
console.log(8.4);

// data type (Boolean) are true or false
console.log(true);
console.log(false);

// data type (null) means no data value has been assigned the
console.log(null);

// data type (undefined) is a variable without passing any value
// this is a variable declaration without a value it returns undefined
let noValue;
console.log(noValue);

//Data type: (objects) is used to store paired data with key and value pair.. also objects can have another object inside you really.. also arrays []

var myInfo = {
  name: "Hanan",
  age: 25,
  location: "NY",
  course: { math: "subtract" },
  school: ["harvard", "stanford"],
};
console.log(myInfo);

//-------------------------------

// declarations are let, var, and const... variables are containers for storing values.. they hold a memory on the computer

//  a var keyword: is not useable anymore due to bugs and errors

// let keyword: works in scope and could be resigned
